# 🧭 RAFEEQ — Product Vision (v1.0)

## 1. What Rafeeq Is

**Rafeeq is an active accountability partner**, not a reminder app.

Most tools help users *plan* their lives.
Rafeeq helps users **follow through**.

It is designed to:
* turn intention into action
* bring awareness when things are missed
* support reflection instead of guilt
* adapt to the level of accountability the user chooses

Rafeeq does **not** force discipline — it **enforces the discipline the user asks for**.

---

## 2. Core Idea — From Intention to Accountability

Rafeeq works in three stages:

### 1️⃣ Schedule Creation (Intention)

Users create their schedule in **human ways**, not rigid forms.

They can:
* chat with Rafeeq (LLM-based)
* paste their daily routine
* upload or describe their schedule

Example:
> “I want to pray on time, work from 9–5, study 2 hours, and sleep early.”

Rafeeq converts this into a **structured daily plan**.

The schedule is always:
* reviewable
* editable
* confirmed by the user before activation

---

### 2️⃣ Execution & Accountability (Action)

Once the schedule is confirmed, Rafeeq becomes active.

For **each task**, Rafeeq:
* reminds the user before it starts
* checks whether it was completed
* records completion or miss
* optionally supports reflection

---

### 3️⃣ Reflection & Awareness (Muhasaba)

Rafeeq does not just track “done / not done”.

It helps users:
* notice patterns
* understand why things were missed
* reflect when they choose to

Reflection is:
* optional
* user-initiated
* never forced unless the user opts for strict accountability

---

## 3. Accountability Levels (User-Chosen)

Users explicitly choose **how strict** Rafeeq should be.

### 📊 Level Comparison Chart

| Level | Name | Channel | Friction | Persona |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Messaging** | WhatsApp / Text | 🟢 Low | *The Kind Friend* |
| **2** | **Screen** | App Notification | 🟡 Medium | *The Strict Teacher* |
| **3** | **AI Call** | Voice Call (AI) | 🟠 High | *The Wise Mentor* |
| **4** | **Human** | Voice Call (Human) | 🔴 Max | *The Community* |

### 🔹 Level 1 — Messaging Accountability (Text-Based)

**Channel:** WhatsApp / SMS / text-based messaging

Flow:
* Message before task
* Message after task asking:
  > “Did you complete this?”
* User replies: Yes / No
* Optional reflection:
  * If completed → reflect on how it went
  * If missed → reflect on why it was missed (optional)

End of day:
* A summary message showing:
  * completed tasks
  * missed tasks
  * reasons (if provided)

This level is:
* gentle
* non-intrusive
* suitable for most users

---

### 🔹 Level 2 — Screen-Based Accountability (Premium, On Request)

**Channel:** App / Web notification screen

Flow:
* Screen pops up before task (e.g. 10 minutes before)
* User must respond:
  * “Ready”
  * or “Changing task / postponing (with reason)”
* After task time:
  * Screen appears again
  * User must confirm completion or reflect on miss
* Screen cannot be ignored easily
* Next task is shown immediately after response

This level introduces **intentional friction**:
* the user must consciously engage
* skipping requires explanation

Designed for users who want **stronger discipline**.

---

### 🔹 Level 3 — Calling Accountability (AI or Human)

#### A) AI Calling
* Triggered only if the user requests it
* Used mainly after missed tasks or for daily check-ins
* Voice-based reflection:
  * “What happened?”
  * “Do you want to reflect now?”
* AI does **not** teach religion or give rulings — it facilitates reflection.

#### B) Human Accountability (Premium)
* User is paired with a human accountability partner
* Completely customized:
  * frequency
  * timing
  * type of support
* Can include evening check-ins or weekly reviews

This level is for users who want **maximum accountability**.

---

## 4. Reflection Philosophy

Reflection is the heart of Rafeeq — but never forced by default.

Key principles:
* Missing a task is not failure
* Ignoring a miss is unconsciousness
* Reflection turns failure into learning

Reflection exists to build:
* awareness
* responsibility
* long-term change

---

## 5. Habit Scope & Evolution Strategy

### The Vision: Standalone Platform
Rafeeq is designed to be a **standalone product**.
While it integrates with apps (like Prayer Times), its core engine (Accountability) is independent.

### Phase 1: The "Salah" MVP (Embedded)
*   **Context**: Built inside the Prayer Time App.
*   **Focus**: Single Habit (Salah).
*   **Goal**: Perfect the "Reflection Loop" and "Persona" with a specific use case.

### Phase 2: The "General" Platform (Standalone)
*   **Context**: A separate Rafeeq App.
*   **Focus**: Habit-Agnostic (Work, Study, Health).
*   **Goal**: Users import any schedule; Rafeeq holds them accountable.

This separation ensures that while we start niche (Muslims/Salah), the technology is built to scale to **general human productivity**.

---

## 6. Pricing & Monetization (Open)

Pricing is **not fixed yet**.

It will depend on:
* operational costs (AI calls, human support)
* communication channel
* level of accountability chosen

Principle:
* Text-based accountability should remain accessible
* Stronger accountability is premium and opt-in

---

## 7. What Makes Rafeeq Different

* Active, not passive
* Accountability by consent
* Reflection over punishment
* Multiple accountability modes
* Human + AI hybrid
* Designed for real life, not ideal behavior

Rafeeq is not about “doing more”.
It is about **doing what you already committed to — consciously**.

---

## 8. One-Line Product Definition

> **Rafeeq is an active accountability partner that helps people turn daily intentions into consistent action through reminders, confirmation, and reflection — at the level of accountability they choose.**
