# Rafeeq (رفيق) - Product Vision

**One-Line Vision:**
> **Rafeeq** is a fiqh-aware Islamic accountability platform that helps Muslims pray correctly, understand their deen, and build lifelong habits through reflection, not pressure.

---

## 🕌 What is Rafeeq?
**Rafeeq** is a **consent-based Islamic habit and accountability platform**. It combines:
*   **Accurate Namaz Timing** (The Foundation)
*   **AI Reflection** (The Heart)
*   **Family/Madrasa Support** (The Community)
*   **Education** (The Clarity)

Unlike other apps, it avoids exploitative ads and gamification in favor of **Tarbiyah (Growth)** and **Adab (Etiquette)**.

## 🏛 The 4 Core Pillars

### 1. Accurate Namaz Time Window (Foundation)
The base layer is trust.
*   **Fiqh-Aware**: Clearly shows and explains differences (e.g., Shafi vs Hanafi Asr).
*   **Educational**: Explains *why* times differ and what "valid time" means.
*   **High-Latitude Intelligence**: Transparently handles complex regions (UK/EU/Scandinavia) with scholarly disclaimers, not black-box guesses.

### 2. AI Accountability Partner (Heart)
Uses prayer windows as anchors for reflection, not just alerts.
*   **Non-Judgmental**: "You missed Asr today — what made it difficult?"
*   **Reflection**: Supports voice-based reflection on spiritual state, consistency, and focus.
*   **Personalized**: Adaptive prompts based on user behavior and goals.

### 3. Madrasa & Family Model (Community)
A digital support system for Tarbiyah.
*   **Tree Structure**: Parent → Child, Teacher → Student.
*   **Consent-Based**: No spying. Visibility is granted by the user to their mentor.
*   **Goal**: Encouragement and mentorship, not policing.

### 4. Islamic Education (Clarity)
Light, trustworthy chunks of knowledge.
*   **Simple English**: Accessible explanations of rules and validity.
*   **Respectful**: Validates differences of opinion without creating conflict.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (What we are NOT)
*   ❌ A Fatwa machine
*   ❌ A ad-driven clock
*   ❌ A social media dopamine trap
*   ❌ A replacement for human scholars/parents

*   Community Mentorship Programs
